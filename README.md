## The Story

Frick Off was born out of the need for a way to quickly delete config files
for whatever editor or other utility that you're just throwing random configs
at.

Maybe you're someone who flips through Emacs or Neovim starter kits or
frameworks.

Maybe you made the grave mistake of using LazyVim and your Neovim installation
just completely fricked up.

Maybe you're a Windows user and /AppData/Roaming/ is hard to get to!

Whatever your use case, Frick Off is here for you, to tell those configs to just
frick off. Even if you don't need it.
