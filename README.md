# Frick Off

Frick Off is a utility that automates the process of deleting configuration
files. It comes with both jokey and serious messages to cater to different
preferences, ensuring a light-hearted or more formal user experience.

version 3. See the LICENSE file for details.

## Unfinished

Frick Off is not very finished, I'm still working on it. In the meantime, you
can delete those configs by hand.
